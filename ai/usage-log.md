I should have 2 test cases per question, so the first test case is index = 1 and the second is index = 2.

Please categorise the all related insert statements by question.

Start the question id from 31 onwards, as I already have questions before that index.

-- Questions table (one difficulty per question)
CREATE TABLE questions (
    id SERIAL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    difficulty TEXT CHECK (difficulty IN ('easy', 'medium', 'hard')) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    constraints TEXT,
	PRIMARY KEY (id)

## Entry 32

# Date/Time:

2024-10-28 14:00

# Tool:

Claude Code (model: Claude Sonnet 4.5)

# Prompt/Command:

Request to implement a complete AI-powered code assistant feature for the collaboration page where users can interact with AI to explain code, debug issues, and get programming help using the code from the Monaco editor as context.

# Output Summary:

**Backend AI Service (ai-service/):**
- Created complete Express.js microservice architecture with routes, controllers, and services
- Implemented Google Gemini API integration for AI responses
- Built aiService.js with conversation history support and code context injection
- Created aiController.js with comprehensive error handling and validation
- Implemented aiRoutes.js with POST /api/ai/chat endpoint
- Added server.js with CORS, JSON parsing, and health check endpoint
- Created package.json with @google/generative-ai, express, cors, and dotenv dependencies
- Built Dockerfile with multi-stage builds for development and production
- Generated comprehensive README.md with setup instructions, API documentation, and troubleshooting

**Frontend Integration:**
- Created aiServiceApi.ts TypeScript client with ChatMessage and ChatRequest interfaces
- Implemented sendAiChatMessage function with error handling and type safety
- Built AiAssistPanel.tsx React component with:
  - Chat message display with user/assistant distinction
  - Markdown rendering for AI responses with syntax highlighting
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality for AI responses
  - Loading states with spinner animations
  - Auto-scroll to latest messages
  - Conversation history management
  - Welcome screen with feature highlights
- Modified CodingComponent.tsx to accept onEditorMount and onLanguageChange props
- Updated CodingComponentWrapper.tsx to forward editor instance and language state
- Enhanced collab/page.tsx with toggle between Chat and AI Assist panels
- Added toggle buttons with icons (MessageSquare for Chat, Sparkles for AI Assist)

**Configuration:**
- Added NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_SERVICE_URL to frontend/.env.local
- Created ai-service/.env.sample with PORT and GEMINI_API_KEY variables
- Updated docker-compose.yml with ai-service configuration (later simplified)
- Modified dockerfile with base and production stages for Docker deployment
- Created AI_ASSIST_SETUP.md comprehensive quick start guide
- Generated detailed ai-service/README.md with API specs and troubleshooting

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Used Google Gemini API (free tier) instead of paid OpenAI API for cost-effectiveness
- Implemented microservice pattern for AI service separation
- Automatic code context injection from Monaco editor
- Conversation history maintained client-side for simplicity
- RESTful API with JSON payloads
- React component state management for UI updates
- Markdown rendering for formatted AI responses

# Action Taken:

- [ ] Accepted as-is
- [x] Modified
- [ ] Rejected

# Author Notes:

- Validated complete end-to-end implementation from backend API to frontend UI
- Confirmed Google Gemini integration provides free tier with generous limits (60 req/min, 1,500/day)
- Tested AI service independently and integrated with frontend collab page
- Verified code context automatically included from Monaco editor with each question
- Security considerations: API key stored in backend .env, code sent to Google Gemini servers
- Cost-effective solution: completely free for development and student projects
- UX design: toggle between peer chat and AI assistant without layout disruption
- Error handling: comprehensive error messages for API failures and rate limits
- Documentation: created detailed setup guides for both development and production deployment
- Maintainability: clean separation of concerns with routes/controllers/services pattern
- Performance: lightweight AI service with minimal dependencies
- Troubleshooting: addressed Docker port conflicts, PostgreSQL binding issues, and dependency installation
