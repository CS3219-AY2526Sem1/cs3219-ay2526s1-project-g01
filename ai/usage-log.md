# Tool:
ChatGPT (model: ChatGPT-4.1)

# Prompt/Command:
Request to implement a reusable debounced input component in React with TypeScript support, extending shadcn/ui Input component with custom debouncing functionality.

# Output Summary:
- Complete React component with TypeScript interfaces
- Custom useDebouncedValue hook implementation
- DebouncedInput component with forwardRef support
- Proper prop extension from React.ComponentProps<"input">
- Integration with shadcn/ui Input component
- Debounce functionality with configurable delay (default 300ms)
- Support for controlled/uncontrolled input patterns

# Action Taken:
- [x] Accepted as-is
- [ ] Modified
- [ ] Rejected

# Author Notes:
- Validated correctness of debouncing logic and React hooks usage
- Confirmed security implications are minimal (client-side UI component)
- Tested performance with different debounce delays

- Validated script paths and directory navigation (cd commands)
- Confirmed concurrently package version (^8.2.2) is current
- Tested npm run dev workflow for concurrent frontend/backend startup
- Scripts support both development and production deployment scenarios
- Clean script properly removes node_modules from all service directories
- install:all script ensures all dependencies are installed across services
- Improves developer experience with single command for multi-service development
